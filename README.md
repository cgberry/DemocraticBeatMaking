# DemocraticBeatMaking

Democratic Beat-Making (DBM) is a website where its partipants collectively plan a musical composition. Planning consists of the participants making their own contributions to the composition by creating pitch patterns and adjusting timbral parameters. It requires  engaging in democratic discussion and debate, collectively deciding which patterns get triggered and when, and formally voting on contributions by the other users. The goal of DBM is to demonstrate how a piece of music can be planned collectively by a group of potentially hundreds of people. The deeper goal is to posit the idea that if the direction of piece of music can be collectively and democratically decided, so can a whole society.
