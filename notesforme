something that i think would be interesting and effective
would be to have each client host their own music,
but the server holds the data of where everything is.

The client recieves the points about where all of the
audio and such has started. This is only checked once
someone makes a connection.

Votes are tracked server-side. Synthetic instruments
can be a part of the experiment, same with presets.
Presets can be the sounds of the instruments and the
midi sequence. I think it would be good to be able
to turn a sequence on and off so as to free up pitch
control. Pitch control would ultimately need to have
the entire party be able to improvise, so to say.

I still like the idea of a sample-bank, but I'd be
willing to axe it. Synth instruments should be the
first things programmed.
